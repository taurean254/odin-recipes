    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chapatis are a popular, unleavened flatbread widely enjoyed as a staple food in 
        the Indian subcontinent and a cherished delicacy and comfort food in East Africa. 
        They are known for their soft texture, 
        simple ingredients, and versatility in pairing with a wide variety of dishes.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All-Purpose Flour (White Flour): to achieve a softer, chewier result.</li>
        <li>Water: To form the dough</li>
        <li>Salt: For seasoning.</li>
        <li>Cooking Oil or Ghee: This is crucial. It is used in the dough, 
            for brushing the layers during rolling, 
            and sometimes for cooking on the griddle to achieve the flaky texture.</li>
        <li>Sugar (optional): A small pinch is sometimes added for a subtle sweetness that balances the salt.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, combine your all-purpose flour, 
            salt, and optional sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Knead the Dough: Gradually add warm water and about 2 tablespoons of oil to the flour mixture.
             Knead the dough vigorously for 10-15 minutes until it is soft, 
             smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rest the Dough: Cover the dough with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let
            it rest for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour. This step is crucial for gluten development, 
            which makes the dough pliable and the final chapatis soft. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Portion the Dough: Divide the rested dough into equal,
             golf-ball-sized portions and roll each into a ball.</li>
        <li>
            Create Layers (The Spiral Method):
            On a lightly floured surface, roll one dough ball into a thin, large circle.
            Lightly brush the entire surface of the rolled-out dough with cooking oil or melted ghee.
            Starting from one edge, roll the oiled circle tightly into a long, rope-like log.
            Coil the rope into a spiral (like a snail shell) and tuck the end piece underneath to secure it.
            Repeat this layering process for all the dough balls.
        </li>
        <li>Rest Layered Dough: Cover the coiled dough balls and let them rest for another 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Final Roll: Take one coiled dough ball and gently flatten it with your palm.
             Roll it out into a final, even circle (about 8-10 inches in diameter) using a rolling pin. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the Pan: Heat a non-stick frying pan or tava over medium heat. 
            It should be hot enough to sizzle a drop of water 
            but not so hot that it burns the chapati immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the First Side: Place the rolled chapati on the hot pan without oil. 
            Cook for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, 
            until small bubbles begin to appear on the surface and the top looks dry.
        </li>
        <li>Flip and Oil: Flip the chapati over. Brush the first, partially cooked side lightly with oil or ghee.</li>
        <li>
            Cook and Press: Flip the chapati again so the oiled side is down.
             Brush the second side with oil. 
             Gently press down on the edges with a spatula to ensure even cooking and encourage the chapati to puff up. 
            Cook each side until golden-brown spots appear.
        </li>
        <li>
            Store and Serve: Remove the cooked chapati from the pan and place it in a 
            serving dish lined with a clean kitchen towel or aluminum foil. 
            Cover them completely to trap the steam and keep them 
            soft and warm until all chapatis are cooked and ready to serve
        </li>
    </ol>
