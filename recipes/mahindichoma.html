        Mahindi choma (Swahili for "roasted maize") is a beloved,
        quintessential Kenyan street snack. It consists of a whole cob of maize (corn)

         and vibrant presence in Kenyan street culture.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Maize (Corn): Mature, fresh cobs of maize are used</li>
        <li>Charcoal: For the open-fire roasting method that imparts the signature smoky taste.</li>
        <li>Salt: To enhance the flavor of the corn</li>
        <li>Chili powder/flakes: To add heat, adjusted to taste</li>
        <li>Lemon or lime juice: Squeezed over the hot maize, 
            often used to help the salt and chili stick to the cob, 
            adding a tangy zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>steps</h3>
    
    <h5>Part 1: Roasting the Maize</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare the fire: Place the jiko or grill in a well-ventilated area and light the charcoal.
             Allow the charcoal to burn down until there is no smoke coming out and a steady,
              medium heat is achieved. Place the wire mesh on top of the heat source.
        </li>
        <li>Place the maize: Lay the raw maize cobs horizontally on the wire mesh.</li>
        <li>
            Roast slowly: The crucial step is to turn the cobs slowly and frequently
             to ensure even roasting and prevent burning.
        </li>
        <li>
            Monitor charring: Continue rotating the maize until the kernels 
            turn golden brown and have a desirable smoky,
             slightly charred appearance on all sides. 
        </li>
    </ol> 
    <h5>Part 2: Seasoning and Serving</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix the seasoning: In a small bowl,
             mix salt and chili powder/flakes to your desired level of spice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season the cob: While the maize is still hot, 
            take a half-cut lemon and dip the cut side into the salt and chili mixture.
             Rub the lemon directly onto the cob,
             which allows the juice to moisten the maize and the salt/chili to adhere effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve immediately: Mahindi choma is best enjoyed hot off the grill as a satisfying street snack.
        </li>
